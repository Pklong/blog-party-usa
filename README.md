# Blog Party USA

This project will provide an introduction to Express and server-side rendering using the JS templating engine Pug. We'll use [Node], [Express], and [MongoDB] to build an application that allows users to view and create blog posts.

[Node]: https://nodejs.org/en/about/
[Express]: http://expressjs.com/
[MongoDB]: https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb

## Getting Started

npm install express as a dependency and nodemon as a devDependency.

### [Dependency vs. DevDependency]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/22004559/4462871 :confused:

## Hello Express

Make an `app.js` file and require `express` at the top. Express will export as default a function which takes no arguments and returns our app object where we will define various properties.
